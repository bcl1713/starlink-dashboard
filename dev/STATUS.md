## Project Health

**Build Status:** ✅ Passing
**Tests:** ⚠️ Manual testing only (no automated tests yet)
**Documentation:** ✅ Comprehensive

**Technical Debt:**
- No automated testing framework
- Should add pytest integration tests
- No CI/CD pipeline

**Infrastructure:**
- POI system: File-based with locking ✅
- Route system: File-based with watchdog ✅
- All services containerized ✅

## Development Workflow

### Standard Development Cycle

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Changes**
   - Update code in `backend/` or `monitoring/`
   - Update documentation in `docs/` or task folder
   - Follow CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines

3. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   docker compose build --no-cache
   docker compose up -d
   docker compose logs -f
   # Test in browser: http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "type: description"
   # Follow conventional commit format
   ```

5. **Push and Create PR**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
   # Create PR on GitHub
   # Target: dev branch
   ```

### Commit Message Format

```
type: brief description

Longer explanation if needed. Explain the "why" not just the "what".

References: #123
```

**Types:** feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore

## Task Management

### Active Tasks Location
All active development tasks are tracked in `/dev/active/[task-name]/`

Each task folder contains:
- `[task-name]-plan.md` - Strategic implementation plan
- `[task-name]-context.md` - Technical context and integration points
- `[task-name]-tasks.md` - Detailed task checklist
- `SESSION-NOTES.md` - Session information (added as work progresses)

### Task Lifecycle

1. **Planning** - Research and document in `/dev/active/[task-name]/`
   - Create comprehensive plan with phases
   - Document current state and integration points
   - Create detailed task checklist
2. **Implementation** - Work through tasks, update checklist
   - Mark tasks complete as they're finished
   - Update session notes with progress
3. **Testing** - Validate against acceptance criteria
4. **Review** - Code review and documentation check
5. **Complete** - Merge to dev, move to `/dev/completed/`

## Context Reset Preparation

### Before Context Reset

When approaching context limits, ensure:
1. All work committed or documented in task folder
2. Session notes updated with current state
3. Next steps clearly defined
4. Handoff notes written if switching sessions

### After Context Reset

1. Read `/dev/STATUS.md` (this file) for overview
2. Check `/dev/active/[task-name]/SESSION-NOTES.md` for latest (if exists)
3. Review task checklist for progress
4. Read planning documents for context
5. Continue from "Next Steps" in active task
