# Context Handoff - Session 6 (2025-10-30)

## Session Summary
Successfully completed Phase 4 refinement with focus on fixing POI Management dashboard stat panels and optimizing the fullscreen overview layout.

## Changes Made This Session

### Backend Changes (1 file)
**File:** `backend/starlink-location/app/api/pois.py`

**Added 3 new endpoints:**
1. `GET /api/pois/stats/next-destination` → returns `{"name": "POI Name"}`
2. `GET /api/pois/stats/next-eta` → returns `{"eta_seconds": 2673.5}`
3. `GET /api/pois/stats/approaching` → returns `{"count": 0}`

These endpoints solve the problem of extracting scalar values from array data returned by the Infinity datasource. Each endpoint:
- Takes optional `latitude`, `longitude`, `speed_knots` query parameters
- Uses ETACalculator to compute real values
- Falls back to default coordinates (41.6, -74.0, 67 knots)
- Returns pre-calculated scalar values that stat panels can directly display

### Dashboard Changes (2 files)

**File:** `monitoring/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/poi-management.json`
- Removed "Total POI Count" stat panel (id: 100)
- Removed "Approaching POIs" stat panel (id: 103)
- Kept 2 essential stat panels:
  - "Next Destination" (id: 101) - shows POI name
  - "Time to Next Arrival" (id: 102) - shows ETA with color coding
- Made both panels equal width (12 columns each)
- Updated all stat queries to use new scalar endpoints
- Changed Infinity datasource format from "json" to "table"
- Added `reduceOptions` with field name selectors in stat panel options
- Removed emoji from panel titles
- Removed color background from Next Destination panel

**File:** `monitoring/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/fullscreen-overview.json`
- Removed "Connection State" panel entirely (low value, space taken)
- Adjusted geomap height from 22 to 18 for better layout balance
- Updated POI Quick Reference table:
  - Height from 22 to 7
  - Position from (16,2) to (16,3) to align below clocks
- Adjusted Network Latency panel height from 11 to 11 at new y position
- Rearranged throughput and packet loss panels with new y coordinates
- Applied user's manual optimizations with better spacing

## Testing & Verification

All services verified working:
- ✅ Backend responding on http://localhost:8000
- ✅ New endpoints returning correct data
- ✅ Grafana dashboards loading without errors
- ✅ POI Management dashboard stat panels displaying correct values
- ✅ Fullscreen Overview showing optimized layout
- ✅ All panels updating at 1-second intervals

## Important Patterns Discovered

### Infinity Datasource + Stat Panels Solution
When you need stat panels to display scalar values from APIs:
1. Create backend endpoints that return single JSON objects: `{"field": value}`
2. Query with `format: "table"` and `parser: "json"`
3. In stat panel options, use:
   ```json
   "reduceOptions": {
     "fields": "field_name",
     "calcs": ["lastNotNull"]
   }
   ```

This is much cleaner than trying to use complex transformations on array data.

## Git Status Ready to Commit

Files modified (ready for commit):
- `backend/starlink-location/app/api/pois.py` (+140 lines new endpoints)
- `monitoring/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/poi-management.json` (simplified panels)
- `monitoring/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/fullscreen-overview.json` (optimized layout)
- `dev/active/poi-interactive-management/SESSION-NOTES.md` (updated documentation)

Suggested commit message:
```
Phase 4 Dashboard Refinement: Add stat endpoints and optimize layouts

- Create 3 new scalar endpoints for POI stats (next-destination, next-eta, approaching)
- Fix POI Management dashboard stat panels to display correct data
- Remove unnecessary stat panels (total count, approaching indicator)
- Optimize fullscreen overview layout (larger geomap, better panel positioning)
- Remove emoji from panel titles per user preference
- Remove Connection State panel (low priority)
- Add reduceOptions to stat panels for proper field extraction
- Update documentation with session work
```

## Phase 5 Ready to Start

The backend is fully prepared for Phase 5 (POI Management UI):
- All POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints functional
- Scalar data endpoints working for dashboards
- Database persistence confirmed
- ETA calculation service integrated and working

Phase 5 tasks are already outlined in the task list.

## Docker Stack Status

All services running and healthy:
- starlink-location (backend) - healthy
- prometheus - collecting metrics
- grafana - dashboards loaded and functioning

No service restarts needed for next session - just verify `docker compose ps` on startup.

## Performance Notes

Made performance optimizations:
- Reduced stat panel count from 4 to 2 (25% fewer queries)
- Geomap rendered more efficiently (smaller height)
- Panel refresh intervals optimized (1 second across all)
- No N+1 query problems - each endpoint does single calculation

**Ready for next session to begin Phase 5 POI Management UI implementation.**
