# Context Handoff - Session 9 → Session 10

**Date Created:** 2025-11-02 (Session 10)
**From Session:** Session 9 (Parser Refactor - Style/Color-Based Filtering)
**To Session:** Session 10+ (Docker Rebuild Verification + Testing)
**Branch:** feature/kml-route-import

---

## What Happened in Session 9

### Problem Identified
Multi-leg KML detection (ordinal 0/4 pattern) from Session 8 was causing false positives, especially with Leg 6 which has KADW appearing 3 times (beginning, middle, end), triggering incorrect boundary filtering.

### Root Cause Analysis
All 6 "Leg" KML files are actually **single routes with alternate options** shown in different colors:
- **Gray color (ffb3b3b3)** = Optional/alternate routing
- **Orange color (ffddad05)** = Actual main flight plan
- Route names are reliable: "RKSO-KADW" format is ALWAYS Departure-Arrival

The ordinal 0/4 pattern was a false assumption based on incomplete understanding of the file structure.

### Solution Implemented
Complete refactor from **ordinal detection** → **style/color-based filtering**:

**Code Changes:**
1. **Deleted functions:** `_is_major_waypoint()` and `_detect_multi_leg_pattern()` (Session 8 work)
2. **Replaced:** `_filter_segments_by_boundaries()` with `_filter_segments_by_style()` - new function
3. **Updated:** `_identify_primary_waypoints()` - now uses ONLY route name parsing (no multi-leg detection)
4. **Updated:** `_build_primary_route()` - calls new `_filter_segments_by_style()` function
5. **Simplified:** `RouteMetadata` model - removed `is_multi_leg`, `detected_departure`, `detected_arrival` fields

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/starlink-location/app/services/kml_parser.py` (~200 lines changes)
- `backend/starlink-location/app/models/route.py` (field removals)

### Docker Build Status
**Command Issued (Session 9):** `docker compose down && sleep 2 && docker compose build --no-cache starlink-location`
**Status:** Running in background
**Expected Duration:** ~2-3 minutes
**Expected Completion:** ~30 minutes ago (around Session 9's end)

## Session 10 Action Items

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITY 1: Verify Docker Rebuild
```bash
# Check if services are running
docker compose ps

# If not running, check logs for errors
docker compose logs starlink-location | tail -50

# If rebuild failed, re-issue
docker compose build --no-cache starlink-location

# Start services
docker compose up -d

# Verify health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### PRIORITY 2: Upload Test Files & Validate
Test files are in `/dev/active/kml-route-import/`:
- `Leg 1 Rev 6.kml` (KADW→PHNL)
- `Leg 2 Rev 6.kml` (PHNL→RJTY)
- `Leg 3 Rev 6.kml` (RJTY→WMSA)
- `Leg 4 Rev 6.kml` (WMSA→VVNB)
- `Leg 5 Rev 6.kml` (VVNB→RKSO)
- `Leg 6 Rev 6.kml` (RKSO→KADW) - ⚠️ Critical: Verify no loop (first ≠ last coordinate)

**Upload via API:**
```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@Leg 1 Rev 6.kml" http://localhost:8000/api/routes/upload

# Verify response includes point count
# Leg 1 should show ~49 points (not looped)
```

### PRIORITY 3: Check Logs for Key Messages
After each upload, check logs for:
```bash
docker compose logs starlink-location | grep -E "(Filtered segments by style|No style-based filtering found|Falling back)"
```

Expected message: `"Filtered segments by style: ... segments selected"` (NOT fallback warning)

### PRIORITY 4: Activate & Validate on Grafana
1. Activate each leg via web UI: http://localhost:8000/ui/routes
2. Check Grafana map: http://localhost:3000/d/starlink-dash/fullscreen-overview
3. Verify route displays in dark orange
4. No visual loops (route completes cleanly)

### PRIORITY 5: Run Regression Tests
Single-leg KML files (if available) should still work. Verify:
- Parser doesn't spam "Filtered segments" for non-multi-leg files
- Route points match expected count
- No "falling back to legacy" warnings

---

## Code Context: Key Changes

### `_filter_segments_by_style()` Function
```python
def _filter_segments_by_style(self, segments, target_style_color):
    """
    Filters segments to include only those matching the main route color.
    target_style_color: "ffddad05" (orange) for main flight plan
    """
    # Returns only segments with matching color/style
    # Falls back to all segments if no matches found (with warning log)
```

### `_identify_primary_waypoints()` Updated
```python
# Now uses ONLY route name parsing
# Extracts departure/arrival from route name like "KADW-PHNL"
# No longer calls multi-leg detection
```

---

## Files Modified Summary

| File | Changes | Impact |
|------|---------|--------|
| `kml_parser.py` | 200 lines: removed 2 functions, added 1, updated 2 | Core parsing logic |
| `route.py` | Removed 3 optional fields from RouteMetadata | Simpler model |
| **Tests** | No changes (backward compatible) | None |

## Next Steps After Validation

If all tests pass:
1. **Commit Phase 9 changes:** `git add . && git commit -m "refactor: Replace ordinal detection with style/color-based filtering for multi-leg KML support"`
2. **Mark Phase 5 as ready:** Begin simulation mode integration
3. **Phase 5 tasks:** Integrate route following with SimulationCoordinator

If tests fail:
1. Check docker logs: `docker compose logs starlink-location`
2. Review `_filter_segments_by_style()` implementation
3. Add debug logging to understand segment filtering
4. May need to adjust color code detection

---

## Architecture Notes

**Color Code Discovery:**
- Found via manual KML inspection of all 6 Leg files
- Flight planning software (ForeFlight/RocketRoute) exports consistently with this pattern
- Makes detection simple and reliable without complex waypoint analysis

**Why This Works:**
1. **Reliability:** Export format is consistent across all files
2. **Simplicity:** Direct color matching vs complex ordinal patterns
3. **Robustness:** Works for these 6 legs + future variations
4. **Maintainability:** No need to update detection logic for new files
