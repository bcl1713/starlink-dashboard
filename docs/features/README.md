## Adding New Feature Documentation

**For Contributors:** When documenting a new feature, follow this structure:

### 1. Choose the Right Location

Determine which feature area the new capability belongs to:

- **Monitoring**: Real-time telemetry, dashboards, metrics
- **Navigation**: Routes, tracking, geographic features
- **Mission Planning**: Mission management, planning workflows
- **System**: Configuration, deployment, system-level features

Add to existing file if feature extends an existing area, or create new file
for entirely new capability domain.

### 2. Feature Documentation Format

Each feature description should include:

- **What it does**: User-facing capability description
- **Use cases**: When and why users would use this feature
- **How to use**: Basic usage instructions (link to setup docs for details)
- **Limitations**: Known constraints or boundaries
- **Related features**: Links to complementary functionality

### 3. Update This Index

Add the new feature to the appropriate section in this README.

### 4. Cross-Reference

Link from feature docs to:

- **API docs** (if feature exposes API endpoints)
- **Setup docs** (if feature requires configuration)
- **Troubleshooting** (if feature has known issues)

**See [overview.md](./overview.md) for format examples.**
