## Overview

This project uses Claude Code's advanced infrastructure to provide specialized AI assistance for common development tasks. The system consists of three main components:

### **Agents**
Specialized AI assistants that handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously. Think of them as expert teammates you can call on for specific jobs.

### **Slash Commands**
Quick commands you type in chat to trigger specific workflows (e.g., `/dev-docs`, `/dev-docs-update`).

### **Skills**
Context-aware guidelines that automatically activate when working on specific files or topics (e.g., `grafana-dashboard` skill activates when working with Grafana configs).

## Slash Commands

Slash commands are quick shortcuts for common workflows. Type them directly in the chat.

### `/dev-docs [description]`

**Purpose:** Creates a comprehensive strategic plan with structured task breakdown.

**When to use:**
- Starting a new feature
- Planning a major refactor
- Need a detailed implementation roadmap
- Want to break down complex work into tasks

**Syntax:**
```
/dev-docs Add historical data export feature
/dev-docs Implement real-time alerting system
/dev-docs Refactor metrics collection for better performance
```

**What it creates:**
Creates a directory structure in `dev/active/[task-name]/` with three files:

1. **`[task-name]-plan.md`** - Comprehensive plan with:
   - Executive Summary
   - Current State Analysis
   - Proposed Future State
   - Implementation Phases
   - Detailed Tasks with acceptance criteria
   - Risk Assessment
   - Success Metrics
   - Timeline Estimates

2. **`[task-name]-context.md`** - Key context including:
   - Relevant files and their purposes
   - Architectural decisions
   - Dependencies
   - Integration points

3. **`[task-name]-tasks.md`** - Checklist format for tracking:
   - Numbered, prioritized tasks
   - Clear acceptance criteria
   - Dependency mapping
   - Progress tracking (‚úÖ/‚è≥/üî≤)

**Example for this project:**
```
/dev-docs Add predictive satellite position forecasting

This will analyze your current position tracking code, design a
forecasting system, and create a complete implementation plan with tasks.
```

**Best Practice:** Use this AFTER exiting plan mode when you have a clear vision. The files persist across context resets, so you can pick up where you left off.

---

### `/dev-docs-update [optional context]`

**Purpose:** Updates development documentation before context compaction or when switching conversations.

**When to use:**
- Approaching context limits
- Before taking a break from work
- After completing significant work
- Before switching to a new conversation

**Syntax:**
```
/dev-docs-update
/dev-docs-update Focus on the alerting system implementation
/dev-docs-update Just finished metrics refactor
```

**What it updates:**
1. **Active task context files** - Current state, decisions made, blockers
2. **Task checklists** - Mark completed items, add new tasks
3. **Session context** - Complex problems solved, architectural decisions
4. **Handoff notes** - Exact state for continuing work later

**Example for this project:**
```
# When approaching context limit:
/dev-docs-update

# When documenting specific work:
/dev-docs-update Completed Prometheus metrics refactor, added 5 new metrics
```

**Best Practice:** Run this before ending a session so the next Claude instance (or you later) can pick up seamlessly.

## Best Practices

### When to Use Agents vs. Direct Questions

**Use Agents when:**
- Task is complex and multi-step
- Need thorough analysis or research
- Want comprehensive documentation
- Planning significant work
- Reviewing completed work

**Ask directly when:**
- Quick questions
- Simple code changes
- Clarification needed
- Immediate fixes

### Planning Workflow

1. **Start with `/dev-docs`** for big features - creates persistent structure
2. **Use `plan-reviewer`** to validate plans before coding
3. **Update with `/dev-docs-update`** regularly to preserve context
4. **Review with `code-architecture-reviewer`** after implementation

### Documentation Workflow

1. **Create docs as you go** - Don't wait until the end
2. **Use `documentation-architect`** for comprehensive docs
3. **Update existing docs** when adding features
4. **Document "why" decisions** in `-context.md` files

### Code Quality Workflow

1. **Plan refactoring** with `refactor-planner` before making changes
2. **Make incremental changes** - don't refactor everything at once
3. **Review each phase** with `code-architecture-reviewer`
4. **Test thoroughly** after refactoring

### Research Workflow

1. **Start with `web-research-specialist`** for external knowledge
2. **Validate findings** against your specific use case
3. **Document patterns** you adopt in project docs
4. **Share knowledge** in `-context.md` files for future reference
