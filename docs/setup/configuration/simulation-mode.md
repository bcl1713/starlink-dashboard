# Simulation Mode Configuration

[Back to Configuration Guide](../README.md)

## Configuration Sections

### 1. [Simulation Mode Setup](simulation-mode/setup.md)

Overview of simulation capabilities, basic `.env` configuration, simulated
metrics (position, speed, network), and route configuration (circular vs. KML).

### 2. [Testing & Tuning Simulation](simulation-mode/testing.md)

Instructions for verifying simulation status, monitoring updates, and advanced
configuration via `config.yaml` (speed, variation, smoothing).

### 3. [Troubleshooting & Best Practices](simulation-mode/troubleshooting.md)

Solutions for common issues (stale position, missing metrics), and recommended
configurations for development, testing, and demonstrations.
