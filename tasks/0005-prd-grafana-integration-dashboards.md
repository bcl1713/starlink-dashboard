# PRD: Grafana Integration and Dashboards (Phase 5)

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Introduction/Overview

Phase 5 delivers the complete visualization layer for the Starlink monitoring
system. This phase builds upon the working Prometheus metrics infrastructure
(Phase 3) and KML/POI system (Phase 4) to create a comprehensive, user-friendly
web dashboard using Grafana.

The dashboard must provide real-time situational awareness of the Starlink
terminal's position, movement, network performance, and proximity to points of
interest. The system must work identically in both simulation and live modes,
requiring no manual configuration changes.

**Problem Statement:** Developers and operators need a visual interface to
monitor Starlink terminal telemetry, track movement along planned routes,
analyze network performance trends, and estimate arrival times at waypoints.

**Goal:** Deliver a production-ready, auto-provisioned Grafana dashboard system
that visualizes all telemetry data, supports large high-resolution displays
(3000x2000), and provides near real-time updates with intuitive navigation
across overview and detailed metric views.

---

## 2. Goals

1. **Auto-provision Grafana** with pre-configured datasources and dashboards
   requiring zero manual setup
2. **Create three dashboards:**
   - Overview: Map + key metrics summary
   - Network Metrics: Detailed network performance analysis
   - Position & Movement: Detailed position, speed, altitude, and route tracking
3. **Implement real-time map visualization** showing current position, 48-hour
   historical track, planned route overlay, and POI markers
4. **Display all Prometheus metrics** with appropriate visualizations, units,
   and threshold warnings
5. **Support flexible time range selection** (5 min to 48 hours) with
   auto-updating windows
6. **Optimize for large displays** (3000x2000 resolution) with fullscreen mode
   support
7. **Provide clear simulation mode indication** with dismissible banner
8. **Include world clock display** showing Zulu, Washington DC, and two
   configurable timezone clocks
9. **Ensure dashboard portability** via JSON export for version control and
   sharing

---

## 3. User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want Grafana to start fully configured so I can
   immediately view simulated data without manual setup.

2. **As an operator**, I want to see the terminal's current position and planned
   route on a map so I can verify it's following the correct path.

3. **As a flight crew member**, I want to see ETAs to upcoming waypoints so I
   can coordinate arrivals and activities.

4. **As a network engineer**, I want to analyze latency and throughput trends
   over time to identify performance patterns and issues.

5. **As a demo presenter**, I want a clear indicator when simulation mode is
   active so viewers understand they're seeing generated data.

6. **As a multi-timezone operator**, I want to see world clocks for key
   locations so I can coordinate across time zones without mental math.

7. **As a troubleshooter**, I want to see threshold warnings (e.g., high
   latency) highlighted visually so issues are immediately apparent.

8. **As a power user**, I want to pause auto-refresh and zoom into specific time
   windows to analyze historical data in detail.

    - `starlink_eta_poi_seconds{name="..."}`

28. **REQ-POI-004:** Distance and ETA values must refresh at the same interval
    as other dashboard metrics.

### 4.8 Time Range and Refresh

29. **REQ-TIME-001:** Dashboards must support selectable time ranges:
    - 5 minutes (default)
    - 10 minutes
    - 15 minutes
    - 30 minutes
    - 1 hour
    - 2 hours

30. **REQ-TIME-002:** Time ranges must auto-update (e.g., "Last 5 minutes"
    continuously shifts forward as new data arrives).

31. **REQ-REFRESH-001:** Dashboard auto-refresh interval must be configurable
    and set to the slower of:
    - 1 second
    - 2× the fastest backend service metric update interval

32. **REQ-REFRESH-002:** Example: If the backend updates metrics every 3
    seconds, refresh should be max(1, 2×3) = 6 seconds.

33. **REQ-REFRESH-003:** Users must be able to pause and resume auto-refresh via
    Grafana's built-in controls.

### 4.9 Threshold Warnings and Alerts

34. **REQ-THRESH-001:** Panels must use color thresholds to indicate warning
    conditions:
    - Latency: Green <80ms, Yellow 80-120ms, Red >120ms

    background or text color based on threshold ranges.

36. **REQ-THRESH-003:** Time series graphs must include threshold reference
    lines at critical values.

### 4.10 Simulation Mode Indicator

37. **REQ-SIM-001:** When `SIMULATION_MODE=true`, a dismissible banner must
    appear at the top of all dashboards stating "Simulation Mode Active" or
    similar.

38. **REQ-SIM-002:** The banner must be implemented using Grafana's text panel
    or annotation feature.

39. **REQ-SIM-003:** The banner must be visually distinct (e.g., yellow/orange
    background, prominent text).

40. **REQ-SIM-004:** The banner must be dismissible for the current session
    (user can close it, but it reappears on page reload).

41. **REQ-SIM-005:** In live mode (`SIMULATION_MODE=false`), the banner must not
    be visible.

### 4.11 World Clocks

42. **REQ-CLOCK-001:** Dashboards must include a world clock panel showing the
    current time in:
    - Zulu (UTC)
    - Washington DC (America/New_York)
    - Two additional configurable time zones (configured via environment
      variables or Grafana variables)

43. **REQ-CLOCK-002:** World clock display should use a clock or stat panel
    showing timezone abbreviation and time in HH:MM:SS format.

44. **REQ-CLOCK-003:** If configurable timezones for takeoff/landing locations
    are not set, the panel should default to placeholder values (e.g.,
    "Europe/London" and "Asia/Tokyo").

45. **REQ-CLOCK-004:** Clock panels must update in real-time (1-second
    intervals).

### 4.12 Visual Design and Polish

46. **REQ-DESIGN-001:** Dashboards must use a consistent, professional Grafana
    theme (default dark theme recommended).

47. **REQ-DESIGN-002:** Panel titles must be clear, concise, and descriptive.

48. **REQ-DESIGN-003:** Graphs must include axis labels, units, and legends
    where applicable.

49. **REQ-DESIGN-004:** The layout must be responsive and visually balanced,
    avoiding excessive whitespace or cramped panels.

50. **REQ-DESIGN-005:** Color schemes must be consistent across dashboards
    (e.g., download always blue, upload always green).

### 4.13 Provisioning and Portability

51. **REQ-PROV-001:** All dashboards must be version-controlled as JSON files in
    `monitoring/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/`.

52. **REQ-PROV-002:** Dashboard JSON files must be automatically loaded on
    Grafana startup via provisioning configuration.

53. **REQ-PROV-003:** Users must be able to customize dashboards through the
    Grafana UI, with changes persisted in Grafana's database volume.

54. **REQ-PROV-004:** The datasource provisioning file must configure Prometheus
    with the correct internal Docker network URL (e.g.,
    `http://prometheus:9090`).

55. **REQ-PROV-005:** Grafana configuration must set the timezone to UTC (Zulu)
    by default.

---

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope for Phase 5)

1. **Custom Grafana plugin development** — Only use existing community plugins.

2. **User authentication and role-based access control** — Use Grafana's default
   admin account. Multi-user authentication deferred to future phases.

3. **Alerting rules and notifications** — Alert configuration (email, Slack,
   etc.) is deferred to Phase 6 or later.

4. **Mobile-responsive design** — Dashboards optimized for large displays
   (3000x2000); mobile/tablet optimization is out of scope.

5. **Historical data export** — Exporting raw or aggregated data from Grafana is
   not required in this phase.

6. **Weather overlay integration** — Mentioned in design doc section 5, but
   deferred to Phase 9 (Optional Enhancements).

7. **Custom Grafana branding** — Use default Grafana UI; custom logos and
   branding deferred.

8. **WebSocket-based real-time updates** — Use Grafana's polling-based refresh
   (Phase 9 enhancement).

9. **Multi-terminal support** — Single Starlink terminal only; multi-unit
   dashboards deferred to future phases.

---

## 6. Design Considerations

### 6.1 Plugin Selection

- **Primary choice:** `pr0ps-trackmap-panel` for map visualization
- **Fallback:** `grafana-worldmap-panel` or core Grafana Geomap panel if
  trackmap is incompatible
- Test both options during implementation to determine which best supports the
  requirements (current position, track trail, route overlay, POI markers)

### 6.2 Layout Approach

- Use Grafana's grid system with rows and panels
- Panels sized in grid units (1 unit = smallest increment, typically 1/24 of
  width)
- Recommended grid for Overview dashboard:
  - Map: 14 units wide (58%), 12 units tall
  - POI Table: 10 units wide (42%), 12 units tall
  - Metrics row: Full width (24 units), divided into 4-6 panels

### 6.3 Dashboard JSON Structure

- Each dashboard JSON must include:
  - `title`, `uid`, `version` fields
  - `templating` section for variables (time range, refresh interval)
  - `panels` array with all visualization configurations
  - `time` settings (default range, refresh intervals)

### 6.4 Metric Queries

All panels must query Prometheus using PromQL. Example queries:

- **Current position:** `starlink_dish_latitude_degrees`,
  `starlink_dish_longitude_degrees`
- **Throughput:** `starlink_network_throughput_down_mbps`,
  `starlink_network_throughput_up_mbps`
- **ETA to POI:** `starlink_eta_poi_seconds{name="Waypoint A"}`

### 6.5 Simulation Banner Implementation

Two options:

1. **Text panel** at top of dashboard with conditional visibility based on a
   Grafana variable
2. **Dashboard annotation** triggered by a query detecting simulation mode
   metric

Recommend approach: Use a text panel with Markdown content and custom CSS for
styling.

---

## 7. Technical Considerations

### 7.1 Dependencies

- **Grafana Docker image:** `grafana/grafana:latest` or specific stable version
  (e.g., `10.x`)
- **Required plugins:** Installed via `GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS` environment variable
  in docker-compose.yml
- **Prometheus datasource:** Must be reachable at `http://prometheus:9090` on
  the Docker network

### 7.2 Provisioning File Structure

```
monitoring/grafana/
├── provisioning/
│   ├── datasources/
│   │   └── prometheus.yml       # Auto-configure Prometheus datasource
│   └── dashboards/
│       ├── dashboards.yml       # Dashboard provisioning config
│       ├── overview.json        # Overview dashboard JSON
│       ├── network-metrics.json # Network dashboard JSON
│       └── position-movement.json # Position dashboard JSON
└── grafana.ini (optional)       # Custom Grafana settings
```

### 7.3 Docker Compose Configuration

Grafana service must include:

- Environment variables:
  - `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=${GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD}`
  - `GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS=pr0ps-trackmap-panel` (or selected map plugin)
  - `GF_DASHBOARDS_DEFAULT_HOME_DASHBOARD_PATH` (path to overview.json UID)
- Volumes:
  - Provisioning directories
  - Persistent volume for Grafana database (`/var/lib/grafana`)
- Network: Shared Docker network with Prometheus

### 7.4 Refresh Rate Calculation

Backend services (from Phase 2/3):

- Simulation engine updates: every 3-5 seconds
- Prometheus scrape interval: likely 5-15 seconds (configured in Phase 3)

Recommended Grafana refresh: 5 seconds (slower than 1 second due to backend
constraints, faster than 10 seconds for near real-time feel)

**Action item:** Verify Prometheus scrape interval from Phase 3 configuration
and set dashboard refresh to `2 × scrape_interval` or 5 seconds, whichever is
greater.

### 7.5 World Clock Implementation

Grafana does not have native world clock panels. Options:

1. **Clock panel plugin:** Install `grafana-clock-panel` plugin
2. **Stat panels with time variables:** Use Grafana variables and
   transformations to display time in different zones
3. **Text panel with custom HTML/JS:** Embed simple JavaScript clock (may have
   CSP restrictions)

Recommended: Install `grafana-clock-panel` plugin and add multiple clock panels
configured with different timezones.

---

## 8. Success Metrics

1. **Zero-configuration startup:** User runs `docker compose up -d` and can
   access working dashboards at `http://localhost:3000` within 30 seconds
   (excluding image pull time).

2. **Real-time data visibility:** All metrics update visibly within 10 seconds
   of container startup when simulation mode is active.

3. **Map functionality:** Map panel displays:
   - Current position marker
   - 48-hour track trail (after sufficient runtime)
   - Route overlay from `/route.geojson`
   - POI markers with labels

4. **Threshold visualization:** At least one panel (e.g., latency) demonstrates
   color changes when values cross defined thresholds.

5. **Dashboard navigation:** User can navigate between all three dashboards
   using dashboard links or Grafana's navigation menu.

6. **Simulation mode indicator:** Banner is visible on all dashboards when
   `SIMULATION_MODE=true` and dismissible by the user.

7. **Portability:** Dashboard JSON files can be exported, shared, and imported
   into a clean Grafana instance without errors.

8. **Time range flexibility:** User can select any of the specified time ranges
   (5 min to 48 hours) and see data update accordingly.

9. **Fullscreen optimization:** Dashboard appears visually balanced and readable
   when viewed fullscreen on a 3000x2000 resolution display.

10. **World clock display:** Zulu and Washington DC times are visible and update
    every second.

---

## 9. Open Questions

1. **Q1:** Should the simulation mode banner also indicate the current
   simulation route name (if loaded from a KML file)?

2. **Q2:** Should POIs passed more than 24 or 48 hours ago be hidden from the
   POI/ETA table to reduce clutter on long journeys?

3. **Q3:** Should the map panel include zoom controls and a scale bar?

4. **Q4:** For the configurable world clocks, should timezone selection be:
   - Environment variables in `.env` (e.g., `TAKEOFF_TIMEZONE=America/Los_Angeles`)
   - Grafana dashboard variables (user-selectable dropdown)

5. **Q5:** Should the Overview dashboard include a "last updated" timestamp
   showing when metrics were last refreshed?

6. **Q6:** Are there any specific color palettes or corporate branding
   requirements for the dashboards?

7. **Q7:** Should the dashboards include a link or button to access Prometheus'
   native UI for advanced querying?

8. **Q8:** For the 48-hour track trail on the map, should the trail gradually
   fade or change color based on age (e.g., recent positions bright, older
   positions dimmed)?

9. **Q9:** Should users be able to toggle the route overlay and POI markers
   on/off via dashboard variables?

10. **Q10:** Should the position dashboard include a compass rose or heading
    indicator visualization?
